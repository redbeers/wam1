            <strong><u>Drama</u></strong><p style="margin-top:45"> 
            Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance:
            a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc., performed in a theatre,
            or on radio or television.
            [1] Considered as a genre of poetry in general,
            the dramatic mode has been contrasted with
            the epic and the lyrical modes ever since
            Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)â€”the earliest
            work of dramatic theory
